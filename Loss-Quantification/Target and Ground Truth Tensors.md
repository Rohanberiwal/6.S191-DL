# Input Tensor and Target Tensor in Neural Networks

In the context of training a neural network, particularly for tasks like semantic segmentation, the terms "input tensor" and "target tensor" are commonly used. Hereâ€™s an explanation of their meanings:

## Input Tensor

The input tensor is a multi-dimensional array that represents the input data fed into the neural network. In the case of image processing tasks such as semantic segmentation:

- **Dimensions:** The input tensor typically has the dimensions \((N, C, H, W)\), where:
  - \(N\) is the batch size (number of images in the batch).
  - \(C\) is the number of channels (e.g., 3 for RGB images).
  - \(H\) is the height of the image.
  - \(W\) is the width of the image.

- **Example:** For a batch of 2 RGB images of size 256x256 pixels, the input tensor might have the shape \((2, 3, 256, 256)\).

## Target Tensor

The target tensor, also known as the ground truth or label tensor, contains the true class labels for each element in the input tensor. In semantic segmentation, this would be the true class label for each pixel in the image:

- **Dimensions:** The target tensor typically has the dimensions \((N, H, W)\), where:
  - \(N\) is the batch size.
  - \(H\) is the height of the image.
  - \(W\) is the width of the image.

  Each element in this tensor is an integer representing the class label for the corresponding pixel.

- **Example:** For a batch of 2 images of size 256x256 pixels with 10 possible classes, the target tensor might have the shape \((2, 256, 256)\). Each value in the tensor would be an integer between 0 and 9, representing the class label of each pixel.

## Example in Context

Here is an example using PyTorch for a semantic segmentation task:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Example of creating a simple model for semantic segmentation
class SimpleSegmentationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(SimpleSegmentationModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, num_classes, kernel_size=3, padding=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = self.conv2(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model, loss function, and optimizer
num_classes = 10
model = SimpleSegmentationModel(num_classes=num_classes)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Example input and target tensors (batch of 2 images, each with 3 channels, 256x256 pixels)
input_tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 256, 256)
target_tensor = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (2, 256, 256))

# Forward pass
output = model(input_tensor)

# Compute the loss
loss = criterion(output, target_tensor)

# Backward pass and optimization
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print('Loss:', loss.item())
