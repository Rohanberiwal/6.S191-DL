# Nottingham Grading System for Breast Cancer

The Nottingham grading system is a widely used method for assessing the aggressiveness of breast cancer. It helps in determining the prognosis and planning treatment. The system evaluates three key components of the tumor, each of which is given a score:

## Components

### Tubule Formation:
This measures how much of the tumor tissue has normal glandular (tubule) structures.
- Scores range from 1 to 3:
  - 1: If more than 75% of the tumor forms tubules.
  - 2: If 10% to 75% of the tumor forms tubules.
  - 3: If less than 10% of the tumor forms tubules.

### Nuclear Pleomorphism:
This assesses the appearance of the tumor cells' nuclei, focusing on their size, shape, and variation.
- Scores range from 1 to 3:
  - 1: Cells look similar to normal cells with little variation.
  - 2: Cells have moderate variation in size and shape.
  - 3: Cells have significant variation in size and shape and look very different from normal cells.

### Mitosis Count:
This counts how many cells are dividing (undergoing mitosis) in a certain area of the tumor. A higher number indicates more aggressive tumor growth.
- Scores range from 1 to 3:
  - 1: Low number of mitotic figures (cells dividing).
  - 2: Intermediate number of mitotic figures.
  - 3: High number of mitotic figures.

## Scoring and Grading
Each component (tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitosis count) is scored from 1 to 3. The scores are then added together to give a total score that ranges from 3 to 9. Based on the total score, the tumor is classified into one of three grades:

- **Grade 1 (Low grade)**: Total score of 3 to 5. These tumors are well-differentiated, meaning they look more like normal tissue and tend to grow and spread slowly.
- **Grade 2 (Intermediate grade)**: Total score of 6 to 7. These tumors are moderately differentiated.
- **Grade 3 (High grade)**: Total score of 8 to 9. These tumors are poorly differentiated, meaning they look less like normal tissue and tend to grow and spread more aggressively.

## How is NGS important for Mitosis Count ?
The mitosis count is critical because it directly reflects the tumor's growth rate. A higher mitotic count indicates a higher grade of cancer, which often correlates with a more aggressive disease and potentially a worse prognosis.

Accurate counting of mitotic figures is crucial for the correct grading of the tumor, which in turn guides treatment decisions and helps predict the likely course of the disease.
