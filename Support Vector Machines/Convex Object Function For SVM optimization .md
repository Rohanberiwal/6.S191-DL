### Convex Objective Function in SVMs

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) use a convex optimization approach to find the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in a dataset with the maximum margin.

- **Objective Function**: SVMs maximize the margin between support vectors of different classes. The objective function is convex, ensuring efficient convergence to the global optimum.

- **Margin Maximization**: Larger margins generalize better on unseen data, enhancing SVM performance.

- **Mathematical Formulation**: For linearly separable cases, the objective function is:
  
  \[
  \min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{n} \max(0, 1 - y_i (\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}_i + b))
  \]
  
  where \( \mathbf{w} \) is the weight vector, \( b \) is the bias term, \( C \) is the regularization parameter, \( \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 \) is the L2-norm of \( \mathbf{w} \), and \( y_i \) are class labels.

- **Convexity**: Ensures that any local minimum found is also the global minimum, facilitating robust optimization.

SVMs are different from neural networks in their optimization process, focusing on finding the best separating hyperplane rather than iteratively fine-tuning over epochs.
