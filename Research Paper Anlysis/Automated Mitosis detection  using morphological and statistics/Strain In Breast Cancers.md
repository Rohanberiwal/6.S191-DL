# Stains Used in Breast Cancer Reports

In breast cancer pathology reports, various stains are used to highlight different tissue structures or components. 

## Hematoxylin:
Hematoxylin typically stains cell nuclei blue-purple. It highlights structures like nuclei and nucleoli.

## Eosin:
Eosin stains cytoplasm and extracellular matrix pink or red. It highlights structures like cytoplasm, connective tissue, and muscle fibers.

## Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E):
Hematoxylin and Eosin staining is one of the most commonly used techniques in breast cancer pathology. Hematoxylin stains nuclei blue-purple, while eosin stains cytoplasm and extracellular matrix pink. This staining provides good overall contrast and allows for the visualization of various tissue structures.

## Special Stains:
Special stains may also be used in breast cancer pathology reports to highlight specific tissue components or pathological features. Examples include periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain for detecting glycogen, Masson's trichrome stain for collagen fibers, and immunohistochemical stains for specific proteins or antigens.

These stains play a crucial role in the accurate diagnosis and characterization of breast cancer, helping pathologists identify specific tissue structures, evaluate disease progression, and determine appropriate treatment strategies.
