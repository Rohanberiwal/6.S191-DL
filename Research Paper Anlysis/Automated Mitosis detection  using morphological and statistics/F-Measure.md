## F-measure and False Positives (FPs)

### F-measure (F1-score)

The F-measure, also known as F1-score, is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. It combines precision and recall into a single measure and is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The formula for F-measure is:

\[ F = 2 \times \frac{precision \times recall}{precision + recall} \]

Where:
- Precision is the ratio of true positive (TP) predictions to the total number of positive (true positive and false positive) predictions. It measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by the classifier.
- Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances. It measures the ability of the classifier to correctly identify positive instances.
- F-measure balances precision and recall, providing a single metric that captures both aspects of the classifier's performance. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates better performance.

### False Positives (FPs)

False positives (FPs) are instances that were incorrectly classified as positive by the classifier when they actually belong to the negative class. In other words, false positives are instances that were predicted as positive (class 1) by the classifier, but they are actually negative (class 0) according to the true labels.

Minimizing the number of false positives is important in applications where false alarms or incorrect positive predictions can have significant consequences, such as in medical diagnosis or fraud detection.
