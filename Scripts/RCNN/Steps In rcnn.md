# Explaining the RCNN Architecture in Detail

## 1. Region Proposal Generation

- **Selective Search**:
  - Selective Search is used to generate a diverse set of region proposals in the image.
  - It works by hierarchically grouping pixels based on color, texture, and intensity similarities.
  - This process results in a set of candidate object regions represented by bounding boxes.

## 2. Feature Extraction

- **CNN Feature Extraction**:
  - Each region proposal is warped and resized to a fixed size.
  - These warped regions are then passed through a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
  - The CNN extracts high-level representations of the content within each proposal, capturing features relevant for object detection.

## 3. Object Classification

- **SVM Classifier**:
  - Separate Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are trained for each object class.
  - The extracted features from each region proposal are fed into the corresponding SVM classifier.
  - The SVM classifiers predict the probability of the presence of their associated object classes within each proposal.
  - Each proposal is classified based on the class with the highest confidence score among all SVM classifiers.

## 4. Bounding Box Regression

- **Box Regressor**:
  - Bounding box regression is performed to refine the location of the proposed bounding boxes.
  - During training, the bounding box regressor learns to predict adjustments to the coordinates of the proposed bounding boxes.
  - The regression targets are computed as the differences between the coordinates of the ground-truth bounding boxes and the proposed bounding boxes.
  - During inference, the bounding box regressor predicts adjustments (offsets) to refine the coordinates of the proposed bounding boxes.

## 5. Final Prediction

- **Combination of Classification and Regression Outputs**:
  - The final predictions are obtained by combining the class predictions from SVM classifiers and the refined bounding box coordinates from the bounding box regressor.
  - The class with the highest confidence score among all SVM classifiers is assigned to each proposal.
  - The bounding box coordinates are adjusted based on the outputs of the bounding box regressor, resulting in refined bounding box coordinates that better localize the object within each proposal.
