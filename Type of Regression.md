# Types of Regression in Object Detection

## Linear Regression
- **Description**: Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the target variable.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Linear mapping between input features and target variable.
  - Simple and interpretable model.
  - Limited capacity to capture complex relationships.
- **Applicability**: Less suitable for tasks where the relationship between features and target is non-linear.

## Non-Linear Regression
- **Description**: Non-linear regression allows for more complex mappings between input features and the target variable.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Captures non-linear relationships between features and target.
  - Can model more complex patterns and interactions.
  - Requires more data and computational resources.
- **Applicability**: Suitable for tasks where the relationship between features and target is non-linear.

## Neural Network-Based Regression
- **Description**: Neural network-based regression utilizes neural networks to learn complex mappings between input features and the target variable.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Flexibility to capture highly non-linear relationships.
  - Ability to model complex patterns and hierarchies in the data.
  - Requires large amounts of data and computational resources for training.
- **Applicability**: Widely used in object detection tasks for learning complex mappings between features and bounding box adjustments.
