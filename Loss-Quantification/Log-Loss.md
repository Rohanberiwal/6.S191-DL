# Binary Cross-Entropy Loss in Deep Learning

## Introduction

Binary cross-entropy loss, also known as log loss, is a commonly used loss function in binary classification problems within deep learning. It measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.

## Definition

Binary cross-entropy loss is used to quantify the difference between two probability distributions - the predicted probability distribution by the model and the actual distribution (the true labels).

For a single instance, the binary cross-entropy loss can be defined as:

\[ \text{BCE}(y, \hat{y}) = - (y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y})) \]

where:
- \( y \) is the true label (either 0 or 1).
- \( \hat{y} \) is the predicted probability of the instance being in the positive class (between 0 and 1).

## Explanation

- **True Positive (y = 1)**: If the true label \( y \) is 1, the first term \( -y \log(\hat{y}) \) will dominate. The loss is high if the predicted probability \( \hat{y} \) is far from 1.
- **True Negative (y = 0)**: If the true label \( y \) is 0, the second term \( -(1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \) will dominate. The loss is high if the predicted probability \( \hat{y} \) is far from 0.

The overall binary cross-entropy loss for a set of predictions is the average of the individual losses:

\[ \text{BCE}_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N - (y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)) \]

where \( N \) is the number of instances.

## Properties

1. **Asymmetry**: The loss is asymmetric, as it penalizes incorrect predictions more severely depending on the true label.
2. **Range**: The loss ranges from 0 (perfect prediction) to infinity (worst prediction).
3. **Differentiability**: The binary cross-entropy loss function is differentiable, which makes it suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms.

## Role in Neural Networks

### Activation Function

In neural networks, the binary cross-entropy loss is used in conjunction with the sigmoid activation function in the output layer. The sigmoid function outputs a probability value between 0 and 1, which is appropriate for binary classification tasks.

### Non-Linearity

Non-linear activation functions like the Sigmoid function enable neural networks to learn and model complex patterns by introducing non-linear transformations at each layer. This non-linearity allows the network to capture intricate relationships between the input features and the target outputs.

### Usage in Logistic Regression

In logistic regression, the Sigmoid function is used to map predicted values to probabilities. The output of the Sigmoid function can be interpreted as the probability of the positive class in a binary classification problem.

## Mathematical Intuition

### Graph of the Sigmoid Function

The graph of the Sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve, which asymptotically approaches 0 as \( x \) approaches negative infinity and 1 as \( x \) approaches positive infinity.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)
y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sigmoid Function')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('Ïƒ(x)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
