## Channels in Images

### 1. Single Channel (Depth of 1)
- **Grayscale Image**: An image with a single channel is a grayscale image. Each pixel in the image is represented by a single intensity value, which indicates the brightness of the pixel.
- **Depth of 1**: The term "depth" refers to the number of channels. A depth of 1 means there is only one channel.

### 2. Multiple Channels (Depth greater than 1)
- **RGB Image**: A typical color image has three channels corresponding to the red, green, and blue components. Each pixel is represented by three values, one for each color channel. This is often referred to as having a depth of 3.
- **Other Formats**: Images might also have additional channels, such as an alpha channel for transparency (e.g., RGBA with a depth of 4).

## Examples

### 1. Grayscale Image
- An image of size 64x64 pixels with a single channel has dimensions (64, 64).
- In a tensor format for neural networks, it might be represented as (1, 64, 64) where 1 indicates the single channel.

### 2. RGB Image
- An image of size 64x64 pixels with three channels (RGB) has dimensions (64, 64, 3).
- In a tensor format for neural networks, it might be represented as (3, 64, 64) where 3 indicates the three color channels.

## Visual Representation

### Single Channel Image
- Each pixel value represents the intensity (brightness) of the image, ranging from black (0) to white (255 in an 8-bit image).
- **Example**: A black and white photograph.

### Multi-channel Image (RGB)
- Each pixel is represented by a combination of three values, indicating the levels of red, green, and blue.
- **Example**: A color photograph.
