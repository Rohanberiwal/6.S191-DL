# Normal Glandular (Tubule) Structures

Normal glandular (tubule) structures refer to the natural tubular formations found in healthy glandular tissue, particularly in the context of breast tissue.

## Breakdown:

- **Glandular Tissue**: This type of tissue is found in organs that secrete substances, such as the breast, prostate, and salivary glands. In the breast, glandular tissue is responsible for producing milk during lactation.

- **Tubule Structures**: These are small tube-like structures within the glandular tissue. They are formed by layers of epithelial cells lining the tubes. These tubules play a role in transporting fluids and other substances produced by the glandular tissue.

- **Normal Glandular Structures**: In healthy breast tissue, these tubules are organized in a structured manner, resembling a pattern of branching and interconnected tubes. This organization is essential for the proper functioning of the breast, including the production and secretion of milk during lactation.

## Assessment in Breast Cancer Grading:

In the context of breast cancer grading, the assessment of tubule formation involves evaluating how much of the tumor tissue retains these normal glandular (tubule) structures. A higher score indicates that a significant portion of the tumor tissue resembles normal breast tissue, while a lower score suggests that fewer tubule structures are present, indicating a more aggressive tumor.
