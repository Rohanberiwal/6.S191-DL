# Regression Analysis

Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly employed to understand and predict the behavior of continuous variables.

In regression analysis:

- The **dependent variable**, also known as the target variable or response variable, is the variable that we want to predict or explain. It is denoted as \( Y \).
  
- The **independent variables**, also known as predictor variables or features, are the variables that are used to predict or explain the variation in the dependent variable. They are denoted as \( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \).

The goal of regression analysis is to find the best-fitting mathematical function (or model) that describes the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This function can then be used to make predictions about the dependent variable for new or unseen data.

There are several types of regression techniques:

1. **Linear Regression:** Assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

2. **Logistic Regression:** Used when the dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). It models the probability of the dependent variable belonging to a particular category.

3. **Polynomial Regression:** Fits a polynomial function to the data, allowing for more flexible relationships between the independent and dependent variables.

Regression analysis is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, biology, engineering, and social sciences, to analyze and model complex relationships between variables and make predictions based on data.
