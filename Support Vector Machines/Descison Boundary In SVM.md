# Decision Boundary in SVM with Hinge Loss

In Support Vector Machines (SVMs), the decision boundary is a crucial concept that separates data points of different classes while maximizing the margin. In SVM with hinge loss, the decision boundary is determined by the hyperplane equation.

## Definition

The decision boundary in SVM with hinge loss is defined by the equation:

\[ w \cdot x + b = 0 \]

where:
- \( w \) is the weight vector perpendicular to the hyperplane.
- \( x \) is the feature vector.
- \( b \) is the bias term.

This equation represents a hyperplane in the feature space that separates the data points of different classes.

## Margin and Support Vectors

The decision boundary is surrounded by the margin, which is the region between the decision boundary and the closest data points of each class, known as support vectors. The margin represents the distance between the decision boundary and the support vectors.

## Maximization of Margin

The goal of SVM with hinge loss is to find the decision boundary that maximizes the margin while minimizing the hinge loss. The decision boundary is chosen to maximize the margin, ensuring a clear separation between classes.

## Focus on Misclassification

The hinge loss penalizes misclassification by introducing a margin, ensuring that data points are correctly classified or lie within a certain margin from the decision boundary. This focus on misclassification helps SVMs generalize well to unseen data.

## Geometric Interpretation

Geometrically, the decision boundary separates the data points of different classes in the feature space. The margin represents the region between the decision boundary and the support vectors. SVM with hinge loss aims to find the decision boundary that optimally separates the classes while maximizing the margin.

## Conclusion

The decision boundary in SVM with hinge loss is the hyperplane that separates the data points of different classes while maximizing the margin. It is determined by the equation \( w \cdot x + b = 0 \), where \( w \) is the weight vector perpendicular to the hyperplane, \( x \) is the feature vector, and \( b \) is the bias term. The decision boundary is surrounded by the margin, representing the distance between the decision boundary and the support vectors. By focusing on misclassification and maximizing the margin, SVM with hinge loss achieves effective classification performance.
