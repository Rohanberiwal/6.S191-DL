Analysis of Paper :  Artificial intelligence for breast cancer detection in screening

Mammograms detection of the Breast reports  , With the goal of the research  of detection  of then True positive value in the detection and  elimination of the false positive , false negative values .
Goal of the research paper  :

The goal of the study was to see if having mammography images reviewed by both an artificial intelligence (AI) system and one 
radiologist can detect cancer just as well as having the images reviewed by two radiologists. 
They wanted to determine if the AI and radiologist combination is not worse (non-inferior) than the traditional method of using two radiologists.

Outcomes:
The primary outcome was diagnosis with screen-detected 
breast cancer, invasive or ductal in situ (or both), within 
3 months of undergoing mammography. 

Secondary 
outcomes were the number of examinations that 
ultimately were not positive for cancer at each stage of 
radiological read. False positive and False Negative  .
