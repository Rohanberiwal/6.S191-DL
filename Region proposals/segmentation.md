### 2. Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)
- **Description**: Adapts standard CNNs for pixel-wise prediction by replacing fully connected layers with convolutional layers.
- **Strengths**: Provides end-to-end training; can output segmentation maps of varying sizes.
- **Use Cases**: General image segmentation tasks.

### 3. DeepLab
- **Description**: Uses atrous convolution to control the resolution of features and improve segmentation accuracy.
- **Strengths**: Multi-scale context; good performance on complex scenes.
- **Use Cases**: Urban scene understanding, road segmentation.

### 4. Mask R-CNN
- **Description**: Extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks.
- **Strengths**: Combines object detection and segmentation; accurate for instance segmentation.
- **Use Cases**: Object detection with instance segmentation in images.

### 5. PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network)
- **Description**: Incorporates a pyramid pooling module to capture global context information at different scales.
- **Strengths**: Effective in understanding the scene as a whole; high accuracy on benchmark datasets.
- **Use Cases**: Scene understanding tasks.

## Object Segmentation Algorithms

### 1. Mask R-CNN
- **Description**: Used for instance segmentation, providing masks for detected objects.
