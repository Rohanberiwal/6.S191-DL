Fast RCNN 
Key Point :
1.Object detection model .
2.Uses object proposal using the DEEP convolutional Neural Networks 
3.Fast RCNN is very better than  the RCNN as It employs the improved training and the testing speed with  the faster efficiency . 


Comparison of the Fast RCNN ON Different pre trained layers  :
1.VGG 16 -> 9 times faster than RCNN 
2.Deep convNets improves the accuracy  of the object detection and the image segmentation  .
3.RCNN is a multi stage pipeline and all the multi stage pipelines are slow . 


Overhead in the multi stage  pipeline frameworks  :
1.Object localization is a big issue that lead to decrease  in the performance  .
Object localization is the scattering of several object in a image  that has to be segmented. 


Two issue that localized object creates are  :
1. Since there are a lot of object in the image ,  several object have to pass through the multi stage pipeline , making  a computational overhead for the system  .

2.The object coordinate or the position  is a very rough estimate  and serval computation to get the precise location has to be done . 

Meaning of "Object proposal" -> Boundary box or a box that is built around the object in the image is the object proposal . The object proposal could have  the object with or may not have the object with the particular feature during the Binary classification or the multi classifies .
The output that the proposed area or the object proposal has the Object with the particular feature  that we are searching for is outputted by the predicted prob / predicted vector (c) . 


RCNN  :overview 
1.Rcnn uses a deep convo neural network to classify the object proposals  .But the notable drawbacks are :
1.Trainign is multi staged
2.Expensive overheads 
3.Object detection is slow .
