# Mitosis Phases and Processes

Mitosis is the process by which a eukaryotic cell divides its chromosomes equally between two daughter cells. It consists of several distinct phases, each with specific events and characteristics:

## 1. Prophase:
- Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids held together at the centromere.
- The nuclear envelope breaks down, and the mitotic spindle begins to form, with microtubules extending from centrosomes located at opposite ends of the cell.
- Centrosomes move toward the poles of the cell, and spindle fibers start to capture and organize the chromosomes.

## 2. Metaphase:
- Chromosomes align along the metaphase plate, an imaginary plane equidistant between the two poles of the cell.
- Each chromosome attaches to the spindle fibers via its kinetochore, a protein structure located at the centromere.
- This alignment ensures that each daughter cell will receive an equal number of chromosomes during cell division.

## 3. Anaphase:
- Sister chromatids separate, with spindle fibers attached to the kinetochores shortening and pulling the chromatids toward opposite poles of the cell.
- Chromatids become individual chromosomes as they move apart.
- The cell elongates as non-kinetochore microtubules lengthen, pushing the poles of the cell farther apart.

## 4. Telophase:
- Separated chromosomes arrive at the poles of the cell.
- The nuclear envelope re-forms around each set of chromosomes, and chromosomes begin to de-condense back into chromatin.
- The mitotic spindle disassembles, and nucleoli reappear in each nucleus.
- Cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, usually begins during late telophase or immediately after, resulting in two separate daughter cells.

Mitosis is a carefully orchestrated process involving the condensation, alignment, separation, and distribution of chromosomes to ensure the accurate division of genetic material between two daughter cells. Each phase of mitosis plays a crucial role in this process, contributing to the successful completion of cell division.
