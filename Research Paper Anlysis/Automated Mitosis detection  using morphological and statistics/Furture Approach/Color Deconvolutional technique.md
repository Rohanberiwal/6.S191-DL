# Color Deconvolution in Histopathology Image Analysis

**Color Deconvolution**:
Color deconvolution is a technique used in image processing to separate overlapping stains in histopathology images.

**How it Works**:
- In histopathology images, multiple stains may overlap, making analysis challenging.
- Color deconvolution separates these stains into their constituent components based on their absorption spectra.
- This allows for a clearer visualization and analysis of individual tissue structures or components.

**Benefits**:
- Improved Analysis: Color deconvolution enhances the visualization and analysis of histopathology images by separating overlapping stains.
- Quantitative Analysis: It facilitates quantitative analysis of specific tissue components, such as cell nuclei or protein expression levels.
