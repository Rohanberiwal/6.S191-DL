# Fuzzy C-Mean Clustering for Mitosis Detection in Meningioma Immunohistochemistry Images

## Overview:
The fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm with ultra-erosion operation in the CIE Lab color space is employed for detecting proliferative nuclei and estimating the mitosis index .

## Steps and Output:
1. **Fuzzy C-Mean Clustering Algorithm**:
   - Partition the image into clusters based on pixel intensity similarity.
   - Identify regions of the image with similar color characteristics, potentially corresponding to different tissue structures.
   - Output: Segmentation of the image into clusters representing tissue structures.

2. **Ultra-Erosion Operation**:
   - Apply advanced erosion operation to refine segmentation.
   - Aggressively shrink boundaries of regions while preserving larger structures.
   - Remove small artifacts or noise from the segmentation.
   - Output: Refined segmentation with smaller details or noise removed.

3. **CIE Lab Color Space**:
   - Use CIE Lab color space for accurate color representation.
   - Components: L (luminance), a (red-green axis), and b (blue-yellow axis).
   - Better differentiation between tissue types or staining patterns.
   
4. **Output**:
   - Segmented image highlighting regions likely to contain proliferative nuclei.
   - Estimation of the mitosis index, providing information on the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis in the sample.
   - Valuable data for pathology analysis and research purposes.

## Conclusion:
This approach provides a sophisticated method for mitosis detection in meningioma immunohistochemistry images, contributing to the understanding of pathological features and aiding in diagnostic processes.
