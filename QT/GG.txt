An integral attack (often known as the “square attack”) is a form of cryptanalysis targeting block ciphers, especially those based on substitution–permutation networks (SPNs). This attack leverages the structure of the cipher by using a carefully chosen set of plaintexts that differ in specific positions while remaining constant in others. By analyzing how these differences propagate through several rounds of the cipher, the attacker identifies “balanced” properties: for certain bytes or bits in the intermediate states, the sum (usually in the finite field GF(2⁸)) over all chosen plaintexts cancels out to a fixed value, often zero. This predictable behavior occurs because the diffusion and substitution layers have not yet fully mixed the input, particularly in reduced-round versions of the cipher. By exploiting these invariants, the adversary can gradually recover portions of the encryption key or reduce the key space significantly. Integral attacks underscore the importance of achieving complete diffusion and robust nonlinearity in block cipher design, as any structural weakness can be used to distinguish the cipher from an ideal random permutation and ultimately break its security.
