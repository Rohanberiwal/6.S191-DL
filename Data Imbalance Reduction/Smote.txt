Introduction
SMOTE is a technique that generates synthetic data points for the minority class by interpolating between existing points. This helps to balance datasets with class imbalances, improving model training and evaluation performance.

Why Use SMOTE?
Enhances minority class representation.
Reduces bias in model predictions.
Improves recall, F1-score, and other key metrics.
Setup and Installation
